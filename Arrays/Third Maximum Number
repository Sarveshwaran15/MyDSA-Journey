Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. 
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
         Long first = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        Long second = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        Long third = Long.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == first || num == second || num == third) {
                continue;
            }
            if (num > first) {
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first = (long) num;
            } else if (num > second) {
                third = second;
                second = (long) num;
            } else if (num > third) {
                third = (long) num;
            }
        }
        return (third == Long.MIN_VALUE) ? first.intValue() : third.intValue();
    
    }
}If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
