A and B are good friends and programmers. They decide to judge the best among them by competing. 
They do so by comparing their three skills as per their values.

Skills of A are arr1= [a1, a2, a3]
Skills of B are arr2= [b1, b2, b3]

Compare ith skill of A with ith skill of B whichever has a higher skill value gets 1 point

Example :

Input: arr1[] = [4, 2, 7], arr2[] = [5, 6, 3]
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: 4<5, 2<6 and 7>3

class Solution {
    // Function to return a list containing the intersection of two arrays.
    static ArrayList<Integer> scores(int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
        // add your code here
        ArrayList<Integer> result=new ArrayList<>();
        int firstCounter=0;
        int secondCounter=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr1.length;i++)
        {
            if(arr1[i]>arr2[i])
                firstCounter++;
            else if(arr1[i]==arr2[i])
                continue;
            else
                secondCounter++;
        }
        result.add(firstCounter);
        result.add(secondCounter);
        return result;
    }
}
