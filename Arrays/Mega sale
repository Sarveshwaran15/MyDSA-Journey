class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int m, int[] arr) {
        // Your code goes here
       List<Integer> useless = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int price : arr) {
            if (price < 0) {
                useless.add(price);
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(useless);
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(m, useless.size()); i++) {
            profit += Math.abs(useless.get(i)); 
        }

        return profit;
    }
