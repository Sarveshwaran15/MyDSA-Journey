Given an array arr[] of positive integers, you need to select all integers from the array in an order that maximizes the total points. For each selected integer, the points earned are equal to the integer's value multiplied by the number of integers already selected before it. Calculate the maximum points possible and return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 4, 9]
Output: 54
Explanation:
Select 1: Points = 1 * 0 = 0
Select 2: Points = 2 * 1 = 2
Select 2: Points = 2 * 2 = 4
Select 4: Points = 4 * 3 = 12
Select 9: Points = 9 * 4 = 36
Total Points: 0 + 2 + 4 + 12 + 36 = 54.

class Solution {

    public static int Selection(int arr[]) {
        // Your code goes here
        int mod = 1_000_000_007;
        Arrays.sort(arr);  
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum = (sum + ((long) arr[i] * i) % mod) % mod;
        }
        return (int) sum;
    }
}
