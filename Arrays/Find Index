Given an unsorted array arr[] of integers and a key which is present in this array.
You need to write a program to find the start index( index where the element is first found from left in the array ) 
and end index( index where the element is first found from right in the array ) 
return an array of length 2 with elements start index and end index.(0 based indexing is used)

If the key does not exist in the array then return -1 for both start and end index in this case.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5] , key = 5
Output:  [4, 5]
Explanation: 5 appears first time at index 4 and appears last time at index 5(0 based indexing)

Java Code

class Solution {
    static int[] findIndex(int arr[], int key) {
        // code here.
      int start = -1, end = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == key) {
                if (start == -1) {
                    start = i; 
                }
                end = i; 
            }
        }

        return new int[]{start, end};
    
    }
}
