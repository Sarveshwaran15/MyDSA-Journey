Geek is learning about functions and calling a function with arguments. 
He learns that passing can take one of two forms: pass by value or pass by reference.

Geek wishes to add 1 and 2, respectively, to the parameter passed by value and reference. Help Geek in fulfilling his goal.

Example 1:

Input:
a = 1
b = 2
Output:
2 4
Explanation: 1 was passed by value whereas 2 passed by reference.

Java Code

class Solution {
    static int[] passedBy(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        int[] val=new int [2];
        val[0]=++a;
        int c=b+2;
        val[1]=c;
        return val;
    }
}
