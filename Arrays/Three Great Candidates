The hiring team aims to find 3 candidates who are great collectively. 
Each candidate has his or her ability expressed as an integer.
3 candidates are great collectively if the product of their abilities is maximum. 
Given the abilities of some candidates in an array, arr[], return the maximum collective ability from the pool of candidates.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [10, 3, 5, 6, 20]
Output: 1200
Explanation: Multiplication of 10, 6, and 20 is 1200.

Java Code

class Solution {
    int maxProduct(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int n = arr.length;
        int max1 = arr[n-1] * arr[n-2] * arr[n-3];  
        int max2 = arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[n-1];    
        return Math.max(max1, max2);
    
    }
}
