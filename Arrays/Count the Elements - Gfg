Given two arrays a and b both of size n. 
Given q queries in an array query each having a positive integer x denoting an index of the array a. 
For each query, your task is to find all the elements less than or equal to a[x] in the array b.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
a[] = {4,1,2}
b[] = {1,7,3}
q = 2
query[] = {0,1}
Output : 
2
1
Explanation: 
For 1st query, the given index is 0, a[0] = 4. There are 2 elements(1 and 3) which are less than or equal to 4.
For 2nd query, the given index is 1, a[1] = 1. There exists only 1 element(1) which is less than or equal to 1.

Java Code


class Solution
{
    public static int[] countElements(int a[], int b[], int n, int query[], int q)
    {
        Arrays.sort(b);
        int[] result = new int[q];
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
            int index = query[i]; 
            int value = a[index]; 
            int count = upperBound(b, value);
            result[i] = count;
        }
        return result;
    }
    private static int upperBound(int[] arr, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] <= target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return low;
    

    }
}
