The two countries of A and B are at war against each other. 
The power of these soldiers is given by arr1[i] of A and arr2[i] of B. 
They can only attack their counterpart enemies like arr1[i] can attack only arr2[i] and not anyone else. 
Both countries have equal number of counterparts. A soldier with a higher power can kill the enemy soldier. 
If both soldiers have the same power, they both die. You need to find the winning country.
Note: If no one winning, then return "DRAW".

Examples:

Input: arr1[] = [2, 2], arr2[] = [5, 5]
Output: B
Explanation: Both countries have 2 soldiers. arr2[0] kills arr1[0], arr2[1] kills arr1[1]. 
A has 0 soldiers alive at the end. B has both soldiers alive at the end.Return "B" as a winner.

Java Code

    public String countryAtWar(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
       
        int countA = 0;
        int countB = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            if (arr1[i] > arr2[i]) {
                countA++;  
            } else if (arr1[i] < arr2[i]) {
                countB++;  
            }          
        }

        if (countA > countB) {
            return "A";
        } else if (countA < countB) {
            return "B";
        } else {
            return "DRAW";
        }
    }
