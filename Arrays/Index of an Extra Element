You have given two sorted arrays arr1[] & arr2[] of distinct elements. 
The first array has one element extra added in between. Return the index of the extra element.

Note: 0-based indexing is followed.

Examples

Input: a[] = [2,4,6,8,9,10,12], b[] = [2,4,6,8,10,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: In the first array, 9 is extra added and it's index is 4.

Java Code

class Solution {
    public int findExtra(int a[], int b[]) {
        // add code here.
          int left = 0, right = b.length;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (a[mid] == b[mid]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
}
