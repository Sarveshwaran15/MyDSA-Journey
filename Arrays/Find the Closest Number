Given a sorted array arr[] of positive integers. The task is to find the closest value in the array to the given number k. 
The array may contain duplicate values.
Note: If the difference with k is the same for two values in the array return the greater value.

Examples :

Input:  arr[] = [1, 3, 6, 7], k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: We have array arr={1, 3, 6, 7} and target is 4. 
If we look at the absolute difference of target with every element of the array we will get { |1-4|, |3-4|, |6-4|, |7-4| }  = {3, 1, 2, 3}. 
So, the closest number is 3.

Java Code

class Solution {
    public static int findClosest(int[] arr, int k) {
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int closest = -1;
        for (int num : arr) {
            int diff = Math.abs(num - k);
            if (diff < minDiff || (diff == minDiff && num > closest)) {
                minDiff = diff;
                closest = num;
            }
        }
        return closest;
    }
}
