You are given an array arr of positive integers.
Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. 
An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. 
The rightmost element is always a leader.

Examples:

Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 2]
Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.

Java Code

class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Integer> leaders(int arr[]) {
        // code here
       ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = arr.length;
        
        int maxRight = arr[n - 1]; 
        result.add(maxRight);
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (arr[i] >= maxRight) { 
                result.add(arr[i]);
                maxRight = arr[i]; 
            }
        }
        Collections.reverse(result);
        return result;
    }
}
