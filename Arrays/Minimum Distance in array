You are given an array, arr[]. 
Find the minimum index based distance between two distinct elements of the array, x and y. 
Return -1, if either x or y does not exist in the array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 2], x = 1, y = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: x = 1 and y = 2. There are two distances between x and y, which are 1 and 3 out of which the least is 1.

Java Code

class Solution {
    int minDist(int arr[], int x, int y) {
        int val = Integer.MAX_VALUE; 
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == x) { 
                for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
                    if (arr[j] == y) { 
                        val = Math.min(val, Math.abs(i - j)); 
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return (val == Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? -1 : val; 
    }

}
