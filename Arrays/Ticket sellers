You are given an array arr[] of ticket sellers where the ith ticket seller has arr[i] tickets. The price of a ticket is the number of tickets remaining with the ticket seller. They are allowed to sell at most k tickets. Find the maximum amount they can earn by selling k tickets. The amount of tickets of each seller is provided in array arr[]. Give the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 6, 2, 4] , k=3
Output: 15
Explaination: Consider 0 based indexing. For first two turns the 2nd seller sells. For the third turn either 0th or 2nd seller can sell. So the total becomes 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

        long result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (pq.isEmpty()) break;
            int maxTickets = pq.poll();
            result = (result + maxTickets) % mod;
            if (maxTickets - 1 > 0) {
                pq.offer(maxTickets - 1); 
            }
        }
        return (int) result;
    }
}
