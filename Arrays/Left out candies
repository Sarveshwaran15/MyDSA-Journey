Given n students sitting in a circle, distribute m candies to these students. The ith student can take only i candies. If ith student does not get the required amount of candies he will not take it. Distribute the candies starting from the 1st student and moving along the circle of students till you reach a student you can not give candies to. You need to find the amount of candies left.

Examples:

Input: n = 4, m = 11
Output: 0
Explanation: You first give 1 candy to 1st student, 2 to 2nd , 3 to 3rd , 4 to 4th then again 1 to first. All candies are finished with none left out.

class Solution {
    public long leftCandies(long n, long m) {
        // code
        long i = 1;
        while (true) {
            long student = (i - 1) % n + 1;
            if (m >= student) {
                m -= student;
                i++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return m;
    }
}
