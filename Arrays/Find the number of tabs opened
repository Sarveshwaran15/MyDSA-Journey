You are given an array arr[], where each element is either a tab ID or the string "END". If a tab ID appears, toggle its state (open if it's closed, or close if it's open). If "END" appears, close all open tabs. Your task is to determine the number of tabs that remain open after all operations are completed.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = ["1", "2", "1", "END", "2"]
Output: 1
Explanation: In the above test case, firstly tab 1st is opened then 2nd is opened then 1st is closed then all are closed then again 2nd is opened.

class Solution {
    public int countTabs(List<String> arr) {
        // Your code goes here.
        Set<String> openTabs = new HashSet<>();
        for (String tab : arr) {
            if (tab.equals("END")) {
                openTabs.clear(); 
            } else {
                if (openTabs.contains(tab)) {
                    openTabs.remove(tab); 
                } else {
                    openTabs.add(tab); 
                }
            }
        }
        return openTabs.size();
    }
}
