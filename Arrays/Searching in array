Given an integer k and array arr. 
Your task is to return the position of the first occurrence of k in the given array and if element 
k is not present in the array then return -1.

Note: 1-based indexing is followed here.

Examples:

Input: k = 16 , arr = [9, 7, 16, 16, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: The value 16 is found in the given array at positions 3 and 4, with position 3 being the first occurrence.

Java Code

class Solution {
    public int search(int k, ArrayList<Integer> arr) {
        // code here
        int index=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++)
        {
            if(arr.get(i)==k)
            {
                index=i+1;
                break;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}
