Given an even sized array arr[], where each consecutive pair of elements represents a height with two fields: feet and inches.
Find the maximum height, where the height is calculated by converting feet to inches and adding the inches.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 1] 
Output: 25
Explanation: (1, 2) and (2, 1) are respective given heights.
After converting both heigths in to inches, we get 14 and 25 as respective heights. So, 25 is the maximum height.

/*
Class of the element of the array is as
class Height {
    int feet;
    int inches;
    public Height(int ft, int inc)
    {
        feet = ft;
        inches = inc;
    }
}
*/
// function must return the maximum Height
// return the height in inches
class Solution {
    public int findMax(ArrayList<Height> arr) {
        // your code here
        int maxHeight = 0;
        for (Height h : arr) {
            int currentHeight = (h.feet * 12) + h.inches;
            maxHeight = Math.max(maxHeight, currentHeight);
        }
        return maxHeight;
    }
}
