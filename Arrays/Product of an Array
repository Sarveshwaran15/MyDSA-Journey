Given an array, arr[] of positive integers. 
Your task is to return the product of array elements under the given modulo, mod with the value of 1000000007.

Note: The modulo operation finds the remainder after the division of one number by another. 
For example, k(mod(m))=k%m= remainder obtained when k is divided by m

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 24
Explanation: The product of the elements in the array is 1×2×3×4=24. Since 24 is less than 1000000007, the output is simply 24.

Java Code

class Solution {
    public static long product(long arr[]) {
        // your code here
        long mod = 1000000007; 
        long val = 1; 
        for (long n : arr) {
            val = (val * n) % mod;  
        }
        
        return val;  
    }
}
