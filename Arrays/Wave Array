Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place). 
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....
If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Note: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to change the original array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 2, 1, 4, 3, 5.

Java Code

class Solution {
    public static void convertToWave(int[] arr) {
        // code here
 for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i += 2) {
            // Swap arr[i] and arr[i+1]
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
            arr[i + 1] = temp;
        }
    
    }
}
