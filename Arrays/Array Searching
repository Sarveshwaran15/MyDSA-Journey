Given an array, arr of n integers, and an integer element x, find whether element x is present in the array. 
Return the index of the first occurrence of x in the array, or -1 if it doesn't exist.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one test case with array as [1, 2, 3 4] and element to be searched as 3. Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.
Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], x = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: For array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the element to be searched is 5 and it is at index 4. So, the output is 4.

Java Code

class Solution {

    static int search(int arr[], int x) {

        // Your code here
        int val=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]==x)
            {
                val=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return val;
    }
}
