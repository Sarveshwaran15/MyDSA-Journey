Given a queue of persons represented by an array of integers, 
where each person is identified by a specific integer, 
find the minimum kilograms of apples that need to be distributed, 
ensuring that each person receives 1 kilogram of apples only once.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The person identified by '1' appears multiple times but will only receive 1 kilogram of apples once. 
Therefore, the minimum apples required is 1 kg.

Java Code


class Solution {
    public int minimumApple(int[] arr) {
        HashSet<Integer> uniquePersons = new HashSet<>();
       
        for (int person : arr) {
            uniquePersons.add(person);
        }
        return uniquePersons.size();
    }
}
