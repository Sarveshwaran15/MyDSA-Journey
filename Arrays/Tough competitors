Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers representing the skill levels of competitors, 
determine the minimum absolute difference between the skills of any two competitors. 
Competitors are considered tough if their skill difference is the smallest among all possible pairs.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [9, 4, 12, 6]
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest difference between skill values is |4-6| = 2.

Java Code

class Solution {
     public int minDiff(int[] arr) {
        if (arr == null || arr.length < 2) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Array must have at least two elements.");
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, arr[i] - arr[i - 1]);
        }
        
        return minDiff;
    }
}
