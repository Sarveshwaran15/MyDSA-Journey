Given an array arr of even size consisting of positive integers.
After sorting the array, find the sum of the product of i-th element from starting and i-th element from last.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [9, 2, 8, 4, 5, 7, 6, 0]
Output: 74
Explanation: Required sum can be obtained as 9*0 + 8*2 + 7*4 + 6*5 which is equal to 74.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 10
Explanation: array is already sorted 1*4 + 2*3 = 10
