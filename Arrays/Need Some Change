Now, as you're familiar with operating on arrays, let's do an intricate task. Here, we'll do a swapping of array elements.
Given an array arr. The task is to swap every ith element of the array with (i+2)th element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]
Explanation: Swapping 1 and 3, makes the array 3 2 1 4 5. Now, swapping 2 and 4, makes the array 3 4 1 2 5. 
Again, swapping 1 and 5, makes the array 3 4 5 2 1.

class Solution {
    static void swapElements(int[] arr) {
        // Your code here
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 2; i++) {
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[i + 2];
            arr[i + 2] = temp;
        }
    }
}
