Given an array arr[][] such that arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, 
the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.

Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's ending time.

Examples:

Input: arr[][] = [[1, 4], [10, 15], [7, 10]]
Output: true
Explanation: Since all the meetings are held at different times, it is possible to attend all the meetings.

class Solution {
    static boolean canAttend(int[][] arr) {
        // Your code here
        Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i][0] < arr[i - 1][1]) {
                return false;  
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
