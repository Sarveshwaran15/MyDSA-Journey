Insertion is a basic but frequently used operation. 
Arrays in most languages cannnot be dynamically shrinked or expanded. 
Here, we will work with such arrays and try to insert an element at some index.

You are given an array arr(0-based index). The size of the array is given by sizeOfArray. You need to insert an element at given index.

Example 1:

Input:
sizeOfArray = 6
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
index = 5, element = 90
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 90
Explanation: 90 is inserted at index
5(0-based indexing). After inserting,
array elements are like
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 90.

Java Code

class Solution {
    // Function to insert element at the given index
    public void insertAtIndex(int arr[], int sizeOfArray, int index, int element) {
        // Shifting elements to the right
        for (int i = sizeOfArray - 1; i > index; i--) {
            arr[i] = arr[i - 1];
        }
        // Inserting the element at the given index
        arr[index] = element;
    }
}
