You are given an array arr[] of integers. 
Your task is to find the count of elements before which all the elements are smaller. 
The first element is always counted as there are no elements before it.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [10, 40, 23, 35, 50, 7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The elements 10, 40, and 50 are such that all preceding elements are smaller. Thus, the count is 3.

class Solution {
    public int countElements(int[] arr) {
        // code here
         if (arr.length == 0) return 0;
        int count = 1;
        int maxSoFar = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > maxSoFar) {
                count++;
                maxSoFar = arr[i];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
