Given an array, the task is to find the difference between the highest occurrence and lowest occurrence of any number in an array.
Note: If only one type of element is present in the array return 0

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation:  Lowest occurring element (1) occurs once. Highest occurring element (2) occurs 2 times

Java Code

class Solution {
    // Function to find the difference between the maximum and minimum frequency of
    // elements.
    public int findDiff(int[] arr) {
        // code here
      HashMap<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            freqMap.put(num, freqMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        Collection<Integer> frequencies = freqMap.values();
        if (frequencies.size() == 1) {
            return 0;
        }

        return Collections.max(frequencies) - Collections.min(frequencies);
    }
}
