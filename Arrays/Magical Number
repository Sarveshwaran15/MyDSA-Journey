Your friend loves magic and he has coined a new term - "Magical number". To perform his magic, he needs that magic number. 
You are given a sorted array arr of distinct integers. A number arr[i] is a magical number if arr[i] = i (0-based indexing).
You have to return the leftmost magical number present in the given array arr, if there is no magical number in the array arr then return -1

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [-2, -1, 2, 4, 6]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is only one magical number present at index 2 because arr[2] = 2.

class Solution {
    public int findMagicalNumber(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]==i)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
