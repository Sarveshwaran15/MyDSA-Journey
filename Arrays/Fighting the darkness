Given an array arr[] representing the size of candles which is reduced by 1 unit each day. 
The room is illuminated using all the present candles. 
Find the maximum number of days the room will stay illuminated (at least one candle having a size greater than 0)

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2] 
Output: 2
Explanation: The candle's length is reduced by 1 in first day. 
So, at the end of day 1: Sizes would be [0 0 1], So, at end of second day: Sizes would be [0 0 0]. 
This means the room was illuminated for 2 days.

Java Code

class Solution {
    long maxDays(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        long val=arr[arr.length-1];
        return val;
    }
}
