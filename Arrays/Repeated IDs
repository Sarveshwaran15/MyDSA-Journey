Geek is given a task to select at most 10 employees for a company project. 
Each employee is represented by a single-digit ID number which is unique for all the selected employees for the project. 
  Geek has a technical problem in his system which printed ID number multiple times. 
  You are given array arr having all printed IDs. Help him to get rid of the repeated IDs.

Input: arr[] = [8, 8, 6, 2, 1] 
Output: [8, 6, 2, 1] 
Explanation: 8 is repeated, so takes 8 single time.
Input: arr[] = [7, 6, 7, 4, 2, 7] 
Output: [7, 6, 4, 2] 
Explanation: 7 and 6 are repeated, so take 7 and 6 single time.

Java Code

class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> uniqueId(int[] arr) {
        //  code here
        ArrayList<Integer> list=new ArrayList<>();
        for(int num: arr){
            if(!list.contains(num))
                list.add(num);
        }
        return list;
    }
}
