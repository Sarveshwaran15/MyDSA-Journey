Given an array arr[], swap the kth element from the beginning with the kth element from the end.

Note: 1-based indexing is followed.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3, 7, 8]
Explanation: 3rd element from beginning is 3 and 3rd element from end is 6, so we replace 3 & 6.

Java Code

class Solution {
    public void swapKth(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int start=k-1;
        int end=arr.size()-k;
        int t=0;
        t=arr.get(start);
        arr.set(start, arr.get(end));
        arr.set(end, t);
    }
}
