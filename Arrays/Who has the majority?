Given an array arr[] of size N and two elements x and y, use counter variables to find which element appears most in the array. 
If both elements have the same frequency, then return the smaller element.
Note:  We need to return the element, not its count.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 11
arr[] = {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,5}
x = 4, y = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 
frequency of 4 is 4.
frequency of 5 is 1.

Java Code

class Solution {
    // Function to find element with more appearances between two elements in an
    // array.
    public int majorityWins(int arr[], int n, int x, int y) {
        // code here
        int xcount=0;
        int ycount=0;
        int val=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]==x)
            {
                xcount++;
            }
            if(arr[i]==y)
            {
                ycount++;
            }
        }
        if(xcount>ycount)
        val=x;
        if(ycount>xcount)
        val=y;
        if(xcount==ycount)
        val=x>y?y:x;
        return val;
    }
}
