You are given an array arr[], containing the IDs of users in chronological order of their occurrences. Find the first user who has exactly k occurrences.
If no such user exists, return -1.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7] , k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Both 7 and 4 occur 2 times. But 7 is the first that occurs 2 times. 


class Solution {

    static int firstElement(int arr[], int k) {
        // write code here
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int id : arr) {
            freq.put(id, freq.getOrDefault(id, 0) + 1);
        }
        for (int id : arr) {
            if (freq.get(id) == k) {
                return id;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
