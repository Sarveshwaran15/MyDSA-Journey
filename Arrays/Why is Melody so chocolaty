Chunky gets happy by eating Melody. Given an array arr[], each element represents the happiness Chunky gets by eating the melody.
Chunky knows why Melody is so chocolaty but will only tell you once you tell him the maximum happiness he can get by eating two adjacent melodies.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output : 9
Explanation: maximum happiness he can get is 9, selecting arr[3] = 4 and arr[4] = 5 which adds up to 9.
Input : arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 4]
Output : 7
Explanation: maximum happiness he can get is 7, selecting arr[2] = 3 and arr[3] = 4 which adds up to 7.

Java Code


class Solution {
    public int maxHappiness(List<Integer> arr) {
        int max = arr.get(0);
        int index = 0;
        int sum = 0;

        // Find the maximum value and its index
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (max < arr.get(i)) {
                max = arr.get(i);
               // index = i;
            }
        }
        index=arr.indexOf(max);
        // Handling edge cases and selecting the correct adjacent value
        if (index == 0) {
            sum = max + arr.get(index + 1);
        } else if (index == arr.size() - 1) {
            sum = max + arr.get(index - 1);
        } else {  // If max is not at first or last index
            sum = max + Math.max(arr.get(index - 1), arr.get(index + 1));
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
