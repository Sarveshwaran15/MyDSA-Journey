Ram and Rohan are participating in a tournament where they must compete against contenders whose strengths are given in an array arr[]. 
Ram's strength is m, and Rohan's strength is n. They take turns competing against the contenders, with Ram always going first. 
A contender is defeated if their strength is an exact multiple of either Ram's or Rohan's strength. 
Once defeated, a contender cannot compete again.

Determine who wins more matches: Ram or Rohan. If both win the same number of matches, declare both as winners.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 5, 7, 6, 9, 10, 14], m = 2, n = 3
Output: "Ram"
Explanation: Ram wins against contenders with strengths [4, 6, 10, 14]. Rohan wins against the contender with strength [9].

Java Code

class Solution {
    public String winner(int[] arr, int m, int n) {
        // code here
        String val="";
        int ramCount=1;
        int rohanCount=1;
        for(int num:arr)
        {
            if(num%m==0)
            {
                ramCount++;
            }
            if(num%n==0)
            {
                rohanCount++;
            }
        }
        if(ramCount>rohanCount)
        {
            val="Ram";
        }
        else if(rohanCount>ramCount)
        {
            val="Rohan";
        }
        else{
            val="Both";
        }
        return val;
    }
}
