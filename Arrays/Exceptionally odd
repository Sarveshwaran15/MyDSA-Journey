Given an array of N positive integers where all numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. 
Find the exceptional number.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3}
Output: 3
Explaination: 3 occurs three times.

Java Code

class Solution {
    int getOddOccurrence(int[] arr, int n) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            result ^= num;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
