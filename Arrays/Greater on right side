You are given an array arr. Replace every element with the next greatest element (the greatest element on its right side) in the array. Note: There is no element next to the last element, so replace it with -1.

Example:

Input: arr[] = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 5, 5, 2, -1]
Explanation: For 16 the greatest element 
on its right is 17. For 17 it's 5. 
For 4 it's 5. For 3 it's 5. For 5 it's 2. 
For 2 it's -1(no element to its right). 

Java Code

class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Integer> nextGreatest(int arr[]) {
        // code here
       ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = arr.length;
        int maxRight = -1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int current = arr[i];
            arr[i] = maxRight;
            if (current > maxRight) {
                maxRight = current;
            }
        }
        for (int num : arr) {
            result.add(num);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
