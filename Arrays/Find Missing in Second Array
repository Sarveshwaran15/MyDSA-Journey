Given two integer arrays a and b, the task is to find the numbers which are present in the first array a, but not present in the second array b.

Note: Numbers to be returned should in order as they appear in array a.

Examples :

Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10], b[] = [2, 3, 1, 0, 5]
Output: [4, 10]
Explanation: 4 and 10 are present in first array, but not in second array.

Java Code

class Solution {
    ArrayList<Integer> findMissing(int[] a, int[] b) {
         ArrayList<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>();
        HashSet<Integer> setB = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : b) {
            setB.add(num);
        }
        for (int num : a) {
            if (!setB.contains(num)) {
                lst.add(num);
            }
        }

        return lst;
    
    }
}
