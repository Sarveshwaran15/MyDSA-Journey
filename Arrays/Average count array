Given an array arr[] and an integer x. 
You have to calculate the average for each element arr[i] and x and find out whether that number exists in the array. 
Do it for all the elements of the array and store the count result in another array for each index how many occurrences of average are present in the array.

Note: Always take the floor value of the average.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = [2, 4, 8, 6, 2] and x = 2
Output : [2, 0, 0, 1, 2]
Explanation: We take x = 2 and take average with arr[0] whch is equal to 2. 
We found 2 resides in array at two positions (1st and 5th element) thus storing 2 in another array at 0th index. 
Similarly do for all elements and store the count in second array.

Java Code

class Solution {

    // Function for finding maximum and value pair
    public ArrayList<Integer> countArray(int[] arr, int x) {
      
         ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            int avg = (num + x) / 2; 
            int count = 0;
            
            for (int val : arr) {
                if (val == avg) count++;
            }
            
            result.add(count);
        }
        
        return result;
    
    }
}
