You are given an array of integers arr[]. Your task is to reverse the given array.

Note: Modify the array in place.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. 
After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, 
the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.


Java Code
class Solution {
    public void reverseArray(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int temp = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
