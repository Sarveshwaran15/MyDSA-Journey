Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes n as a parameter and prints the number from 1 to n recursively.

Note: Don't print any newline, it will be added by the driver code.

Examples:

Input: n = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Java Code


package DataStructures.Recursion;

public class Print1ToN {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print(1, 5);
    }

    static void print(int current, int n) {
        if (current > n) return;  // base case
        System.out.println(current);
        print(current + 1, n);    // recursive call with increment
    }
}
