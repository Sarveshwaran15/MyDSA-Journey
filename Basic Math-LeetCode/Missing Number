Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Java Code

class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result=0;
        int n=nums.length;
        for(int n1:nums)
        {
            result+=n1;
        }
        int sum=n*(n+1)/2;
        return sum-result;
    }
}
