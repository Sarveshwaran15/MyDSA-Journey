You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers.
The elements in the array arr[] range from 1 to n (where n is the size of the array), and some numbers may be repeated or absent.
Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers in the range 1 to n and return an array of size n such that result[i] represents the frequency of the number i (1-based indexing).

Examples

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 2, 3, 5]
Output: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]
Explanation: We have: 1 occurring 0 times, 2 occurring 2 times, 3 occurring 2 times, 4 occurring 0 times, and 5 occurring 1 time.

Java Code
class Solution {
    // Function to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N in the array.
    public List<Integer> frequencyCount(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] freq = new int[n]; 
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num >= 1 && num <= n) {
                freq[num - 1]++; 
            }
        }
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int count : freq) {
            result.add(count);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
